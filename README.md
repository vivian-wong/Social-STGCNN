# Social-TGCN
Code for "Social-TGCN", a Stanford CS229 project. I used GCN with GRU to achieve Social-LSTM level accuracy in human pedestrian trajectory prediction on the ETH and UCY datasets. 
Data and some training codes are acquired from Social-STGCNN (the forked repo).
See my report at CS229_report.pdf
